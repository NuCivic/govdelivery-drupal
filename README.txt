INTRODUCTION
------------

The GovDelivery TMS Integration module provides Drupal integration with the
GovDelivery Transactional Messaging Service (TMS). The module replaces the
backend SMTP library in your Drupal site with calls to the GovDelivery service,
so all mail sent from your site uses the TMS service.
