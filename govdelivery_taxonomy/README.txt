INTRODUCTION

Give your stakeholders flexibility in topic subscription. The
GovDelivery taxonomy integration module for Drupal integrates creates subscription
topics for every taxonomy term or content tag that you create within your Drupal
instance. Your website visitors will be able to subscribe to the taxonomy
terms and content tags. When a new page, story, or custom content type is
published with tags, all interested subscribers will be automatically notified
with a DCM Bulletin send.
